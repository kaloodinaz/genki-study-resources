### Using the Offline Version
If you're using the offline version you'll have to unzip the files. Once you've done that, you can access all the study resources by opening any of the [**index.html**](https://i62.servimg.com/u/f62/18/21/41/30/captur11.png) files in the browser of your choice. It should have the same experience as the online version, however, whenever new exercises/lessons are added they will not be available; you'll have to download the latest version of the repository to get them.

**If icons are broken:** If you use Firefox and icons appear broken, then please see [this topic](https://kaloodinaz.github.io/genki-study-resources/help/broken-icons/) to resolve the issue.

**If settings will not save:** If your settings will not save, such as furigana preference or dark mode, please see [this topic](https://kaloodinaz.github.io/genki-study-resources/help/stuck-loading/) for resolving the issue.
